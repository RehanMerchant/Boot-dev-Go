Explanation: 
var f func(func(int,int) int, int) int
Copy icon
var f - We're declaring a variable named f
func - f is a function
Now for its parameters (inside the first parentheses):
First parameter: func(int,int) int - This is itself a function that takes two ints and returns an int
Second parameter: int - Just a simple integer
Final int - This is the return type of f
So f is a function that:

Takes 2 parameters:
A function (that takes 2 ints and returns an int)
An integer
Returns an integer
