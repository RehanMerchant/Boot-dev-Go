Ans: Anonymous struct prevent you from re-using a structs defination you never intended to re-use

Explanation:
1. Quick One-Time Data Structure
When you only need a struct for a single function or operation, defining a full struct type can be unnecessary.
This avoids cluttering the package with a named type that’s used only once.
2. Avoiding Unnecessary Type Definitions
If you don’t need to reuse the struct elsewhere, an anonymous struct keeps things minimal and avoids polluting the package namespace.
3. Returning Multiple Values in a Readable Way
Instead of returning multiple values from a function as separate variables, you can wrap them in an anonymous struct.
