A.Install go locally

1.The easiest way (in my opinion) is to use Webi to install Go.
2.Otherwise, the official download page is also a great option.

type `go version` in terminal to check if its installed or not i will return 
go version and your system architecture.


B.install and login to boot.dev cli too whith your same account

C.With the CLI working, and Go installed, run and submit the tests.
