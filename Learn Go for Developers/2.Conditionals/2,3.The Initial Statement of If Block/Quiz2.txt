Ans:To Keep the code concise and scoped limited

Explanation: It makes the code more concise (shorter)
It limits the scope of variables to just the if block
Among the choices:

"To speed up my code" - Would initializing a variable in the if statement make it run faster?
"To keep the code concise and the scope limited" - Does this match what we learned?
"To confuse other programmers" - While Go syntax might be unfamiliar at first, is confusion ever a good programming goal?
