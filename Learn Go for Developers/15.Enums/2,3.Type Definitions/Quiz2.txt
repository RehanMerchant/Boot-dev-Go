Ans: checkPermission(Admin)


checkPermission(Write)
✅ Valid
Write is a constant of type perm, and checkPermission expects a perm argument.

checkPermission(User)
✅ Valid
User is explicitly defined as perm("user"), so it matches the function parameter type.

checkPermission(Read)
✅ Valid
Read is a constant of type perm, and checkPermission expects a perm argument.

checkPermission(Admin)
❌ Compiler Error
Admin is declared as var Admin = "admin", which is of type string, not perm.
Since checkPermission expects a perm, passing a string will cause a type mismatch error.
