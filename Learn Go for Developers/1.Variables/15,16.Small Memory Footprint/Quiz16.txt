Ans: To cleanup unused memory

Explanation: The lesson mentions that Go programs include something called the "Go Runtime" in their executables. Let's think about what the lesson specifically says about its purpose:

The lesson mentions that one of the runtime's jobs is to "clean up unused memory at runtime"
It does this using something called a "garbage collector"
Looking at our choices:

Styling code isn't a runtime activity - that happens during development
Scaring developers (while amusing!) isn't a purpose of any runtime
Compilation happens before the program runs, not during runtime
Cleaning up unused memory is explicitly mentioned in the lesson
