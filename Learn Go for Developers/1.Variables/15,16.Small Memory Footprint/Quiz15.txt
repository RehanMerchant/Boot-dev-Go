Ans: Java

Explanation: Java: Uses more memory because it runs on a virtual machine (the JVM) and often uses a larger heap. This extra abstraction layer contributes to higher memory usage compared to the other languages.
Go: Uses a small amount of memory because its runtime and garbage collector are lightweight and efficient.
Rust and C: Use less memory than Go, giving developers more manual control over memory optimization.
The correct answer is Java, as it's noted in the lesson for having higher memory usage compared to Go, Rust, and C.
