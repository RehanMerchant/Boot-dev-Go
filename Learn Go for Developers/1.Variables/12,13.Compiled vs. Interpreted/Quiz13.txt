Ans:Python

Explanation: Rust: Rust is a compiled language. This means that its source code is transformed into machine code by a compiler before running, and you only need the resulting binary to execute the program.

Python: Python is an interpreted language. An interpreter reads and executes its source code directly at runtime. This allows for flexibility but often results in slower execution compared to compiled languages.

Go: Go is a compiled language. Like Rust, it generates a stand-alone binary after compilation, which can run without needing a Go environment.

C++: C++ is also a compiled language, relying on a compiler to generate executables.

Thus, Python is the correct choice because it is interpreted, meaning its code is executed step-by-step by an interpreter rather than being pre-compiled into a binary.
