Ans: Bits

Explanation: When we see types like int8, int16, int32, or uint64, the number in the type name refers to the number of bits used to store that value in memory.

Think of bits like little boxes that can hold either a 0 or 1. The more bits you have, the bigger the number you can store. For example:

int8 uses 8 bits
int16 uses 16 bits
int32 uses 32 bits
uint64 uses 64 bits
